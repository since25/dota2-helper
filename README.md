# Dota 2 Helper



An AI-powered web application that provides gameplay tips, skill builds, and item recommendations for Dota 2 players based on their team composition and matchup.



## Features

* Select your hero, role, 4 allies, and 5 opponents from a filterable list with abbreviation support (e.g., "am" → "Anti-Mage").
* **Current patch data** - Hero abilities and item stats pulled from `dotaconstants` (updated with each Dota 2 patch).
* **Lane matchup analysis** - Enemy abilities context for your specific lane opponents.
* **Teammate synergies** - Combo suggestions with your allies.
* Structured advice covering laning, mid game, late game, and item progression.
* **Freemium model** - 3 free queries/day, unlimited with Pro ($3/month via Stripe).
* Responsive dark theme inspired by Dota 2 aesthetics.

## How it Works

1. The frontend captures hero selections and roles.
2. Data is sent to a Node.js backend API running as a serverless function on Vercel.
3. The backend validates heroes and determines lane matchups based on roles.
4. Current hero abilities and item data are loaded from `dotaconstants` (Dota 2 game data package).
5. A structured prompt with ability stats, item references, and matchup context is sent to an OpenAI-compatible AI endpoint. Groq is the default provider.
6. The AI response is rendered as formatted HTML with tables, lists, and styled sections.

## Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/samikhanjid/dota2-helper.git
    cd dota2-helper
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create Environment File:**
Create a file named `.env` in the project root.

For a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

   ```
    AI_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
    AI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_OR_LEAVE_EMPTY
    AI_MODEL=YOUR_MODEL_NAME
    ```

For the default Groq setup, you can still use:

   ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

Optional AI settings:

   ```
    AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
    AI_INCLUDE_REASONING_EFFORT=false
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```
    npm run dev
    ```

   This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3002`.

   ## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express (serverless on Vercel)
* **AI:** OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint (Groq by default, self-hosted supported)
* **Game Data:** [dotaconstants](https://github.com/odota/dotaconstants) - parsed Dota 2 game files
* **Payments:** Stripe (subscriptions + webhooks)
* **Rate Limiting:** Upstash Redis
